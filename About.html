			<div></div>
			<p>Hi! I am a senior in the industrial design program at the University of Illinois, Urbana
				Champaign. My working experience encompasses product design, user interface, and
				user experience design.

Research
			<br><br>
My research studies user behaviors in both physical and digital experience in design,
creating products that communicate their ideas effectively. Instead of passively applying
all of the user needs in design, I select them discernibly and point out the best options
for the users. The main focus of my research is to bring changes in quality, rather than
mere quantity or novelty. I am interested in sustainable products and services that leave
positive impacts on peopleâ€™s lives and their living environment. With more and more
companies invest in research in sustainability, turning perspectives in traditional product
designs and services can be challenging but still deliverable under careful consideration
and validation.

Ideation
			<br><br>
The understanding of the working mechanism in both physical structures in products
and coding language in UI/UX projects helps me to deliver a robust and feasible design
that creates differentiable products and services and adds value to the current market. I
have accumulated skills in both research and ideation that allows me to be good at
working around with constraints, define design goals within reach, and create the
designs that align with the goal.</p>

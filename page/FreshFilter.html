		  <p class="FFpbp">
		    An application design that eliminates the barriers towards healthy and sustainable diets. It serves as a dietitian analyzing information relating to diet and health that guides the users in the shopping, cooking, and preservation processes. <br>
  <br>
		    As different users adopt different behavioral points, instead of crafting persona with a linear using processes, the application serves as a reference during discrete  
			
		
			  
			decision making moments in different scenarios, such as at home and groceries. <br>
  <br>
		    It links these processes for each users and lifts the burden of precisely
		    calculating nutritional intake and budget, while eliminating unnecessary food waste. <br>
  <br>
		    Grocery shopping with quality and speed is made possible by the implementation of a filter feature that recognizes the food or 
			scans the bar code, revealing layers of processing (carbon footprint) and alerting harmful ingredients. <br>
  <br>
			To achieve effective changes towards a healthy diet, the static dietary guideline is turned into portions for each specific food with units that are easy to apply, calculating macro and micro nutrients components in the food directly.

		117 million American adults have one or more preventable diet-related chronic diseases. <br> <br>

		Available scientific evidence strongly indicates the need for appropriate diet for health. Adequate intake of both macronutrient and micronutrient is overlooked but the most affordable and sustainable option for preventing chronic disease and medical costs involved. <br><br>

		Diet and nutrition application can be part of the  solutions but does not improve the quality of the food selection and a slow food data input procedure. Health and well-being websites provide articles that require time to learn and memorize and can not be applied instantaneously during cooking and grocery shopping. <br><br>

		For individuals that want to use the dietary guideline such as the one issued by USDA, specifications are proven to be hard to use in real life and too general to be effective. </p>

			The food waste produces 4.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, while hunger is part of 800 million peopleâ€™s lives. <br><br>

			Purchasing and consuming unnecessary and excessive food not only cost more for each consumer but also results in obesity and other related diseases. The consequence also includes adding false figures to the agricultural industry that cumulate more resources than actually needed.<br><br>
			
			Over-farming has detrimental effects in the local environment in places with an economy that depends solely on one or a few types of agricultural produce. The process also generates an overflow of greenhouse gases. <br><br>

			The cause of food waste can be an overestimation of the food needed, improper food preservation, and lack of cooking experience that ends up with failed meals such as burned food. <br><br>

		<p class="FFdescription3">Consumers are becoming more attentive to the effect of their purchase on food on health. The nutrition labels on the food products can only reveal how much nutrients are contained, but consumers have to manually calculate whether their diet meets the recommended amount. <br><br>

		65% of shoppers stress the need for healthy, nutritious choices when ordering from retail food service, The Power of Food service at Retail 2019 published by the Food Marketing Institute shows. <br><br>

		The 2015 Whole Health Consumer Survey found that more shoppers are heavily influenced by online sources (57 percent) than by their doctor (42 percent) when it comes to obtaining food and health information. <br><br>

		In the digital age, mobile phone unquestionably becomes the instant and convenient source of information that guides people through tough selections in-store, as professional helps do not accompany each person all the time. However, online information can be abundant and unsorted to be directly applied during cooking and grocery shopping.

		Users do not always know the best options for them. It is important to discern the needs found in the user research selectively.  Convenience, precision, less waste, optimization, and evidence-based were the starting points of mapping out the different processes of use. The final concept ensures a healthy diet basis while making the process convenient. The interactive prototype was built to show the ideas and using process. <br><br>

		
		To validate the idea, a study was conducted with a focus on the effect of planning with scientific nutritional guideline on understanding the healthy diet and shopping. The preparation also saved them from purchasing unnecessary food during grocery shopping. It can be inferred how the application as a two-way data stream can improve the traditional one-way RDI guideline. Participants that previously had planning and healthy eating habits reported are accustomed to the process, while others recognized the benefits of the regime and the effort needed to adopt the planning habit. The fact that participants indicate their willingness to continue practicing meal plans and healthy choices once the healthy diets are provided and if the process can be less complicated may show that the existence of better options can assist the users to change their unhealthy behaviors. The study further proves the fact that effective design should point out the healthy choices for the users rather than passively reflecting all of the responses found in user research without considering the consequences.

		Some people may go to the grocery several times a week, while others only go for once. Behavioral points between different users may have overlaps, but can not be resolved into one single version of using process. Instead of crafting persona with a fixed using processes, the application serves as a reference during the discrete decision making moments in different scenarios, such as at home and groceries. Through each step, users can utilize the analysis to make informed decisions. By keep refining and stick to their plans, users can make improvements in their health.

It categories the food by the main source of macro-nutrient and the additional source of micro-nutrients to avoid the ambiguity. Users can choose the units of food portions they are most familiar with.

		<article><p1 class="PS">An application design that eliminates the barriers towards healthy and sustainable diets. It serves as a dietitian analysing information relating to diet and health that guides the users in the shopping, cooking, and preservation processes. As different users adopt different behavioral points, instead of crafting persona with a linear using processes, the application serves as a reference during discrete decision making moments in different scenarios, such as at home and groceries. It links these processes for each users and lifts the burden of precisely calculating nutritional intake and budget, while eliminating unnecessary food waste. Grocery shopping with quality and speed is made possible by the implementation of a filter feature that recognizes the food or scans the bar code, revealing layers of processing (carbon footprint) and alerting harmful ingredients. To achieve effective changes towards a healthy diet, the static dietary guideline is turned into portions for each specific food with units that are easy to apply, calculating macro and micro nutrients components in the food directly.

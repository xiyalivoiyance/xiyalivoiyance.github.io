		<article><p1 class="PS">Nowadays, toasters do not differ in their quality of toasting, but their appearance and excessive functions. The heating mechanism of traditional toaster determines its inability to provide the consistent toasting quality and its safety hazards concurrently. Various forms and different marketing schemes stir up users’ expectations but does not function accordingly, resulting in returns or end up in landfills, wasting valuable time, money, and natural resources. The redesign, an induction heating toaster considers the consequences of the design and the users’ lifestyle. It ensures quality in the product and takes usage into account rather than ownership by providing a product in service throughout the entire product path. By doing so, it aims for a design that lasts longer and does not lose its value once the users no longer needs it. </p1>

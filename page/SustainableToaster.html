		<article><p1 class="PS">Nowadays, toasters do not differ in their quality of toasting, but their appearance and excessive functions. The heating mechanism of traditional toaster determines its inability to provide the consistent toasting quality and its safety hazards concurrently. Various forms and different marketing schemes stir up users’ expectations but does not function accordingly, resulting in returns or end up in landfills, wasting valuable time, money, and natural resources. The redesign, an induction heating toaster considers the consequences of the design and the users’ lifestyle. It ensures quality in the product and takes usage into account rather than ownership by providing a product in service throughout the entire product path. By doing so, it aims for a design that lasts longer and does not lose its value once the users no longer needs it. </p1>

	<p1>The price for a toaster does not vary by quality but by appearance and excessive functions. The current market is saturated with a large number of toasters in different styles and various features. Online reviews have shown that the most common complaints of toasters are their toasting quality. However, the same heating mechanism is shared by toasters. It does not provide even heating and highly energy inefficient, concluded by several energy analysis reports. </p1>

	<p1>5. Ideation <br><br>The ideation of the toaster focuses on addressing the problems discovered in the research stage. It should eliminate the pain points in the using process while incorporating a better heating mechanism that provides qualitative toast and improve energy use. Under such criteria, three types of forms were chosen to be experimented in the prototypes. </p1>

	<p1>6. prototype <br> <br>The low fidelity prototypes explored the forms from the ideation process and considered the ones that can provide a smooth using process. The selected one was built into the actual size model to validate the idea. It has a front opening that can also be used as a tray transporting the finished toast to the serving plate. </p1>

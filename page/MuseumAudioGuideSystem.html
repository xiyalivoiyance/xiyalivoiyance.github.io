		<article><p1 class="PS">Museums are known as educational spaces for a broad audience. Part of many visitors’ experience, the audio guide system guides visitors by storytellings in the museum and its exhibition information. Statistics have shown that audio guides have a low take-up rate. Several research and interviews indicate that the content and design of current audio guide system needs to be improved. The design aligns the audio guide contents with different visitors’ behaviours. It considers the relationship between visitors and the museum, narrowing down different possibilities into an inclusive service that suits individual needs, re-imagining an intuitive and immersive museum visiting experience. With Bluetooth technology, it proposes a convenient hand-free viewing experience with a neck speaker and an optional interactive app.</p1>

	<p1 class="MAGS-dscp1">850,000,000 people visit museums every year in the US. A case study conducted in the British Museum revealed that with 7 million visitors, only 3% uses museum audio guides. Interviews and surveys have shown that people’s motivation towards audio guides are different and the actual use will depend heavily on individual’s judgement on the usefulness of audio guides. To adapt and improve accordingly, the new design tailors its advantage to three types of museum goers: independent visitors, dependent tourists, and curious explorers.

	  <p2 class="MAGS-dscp3">Visitors only need to select tours in the beginning when they rent the device. The audio guide can be used without a mobile application which can be an add-on when more controls over the audio content is desired. The audio contents curated by the museum are automatically triggered by Bluetooth transmitters, while helping the users navigate in the museum space. Around-the-neck design avoids the sanitisation problems arising in the traditional over-the-ear headphones. The gear itself has retractable cores that suits all kinds of body figures.

The tours are labeled by different attributes that affects visitors’ motivation such as time, contents, and amounts of terminologies, conveying the benefits of audio guides.  The application serves as an add-on to the bluetooth speaker. Users can opt for a completely hand-free museum tour or choose to utilize the features in the application. The contents are categorised into tours that meets different museum goers’ behavioural segmentation.
